# ModelEarth

This is one of the assignments for my computer graphics course in which we used sphere tessellation to approximate the earth's sphere, use 3D Viewing, Projection, Transformation to view the model.

Displacement mapping remains to be implemented which requires translation of spherical coordinates to 2D coordinates of the earth elevation image and raise the surface of the sphere to map the earth's elevation as described in the grayscale image.
